# Generate a Passphrase
A simple, secure passphrase generator built with JavaScript. 

# How it works
The browser gets 4 random words from a list, and stores it in a variable. The variable is added to HTML.
The Poppins font is from [fonts.upset.dev](https://upset.dev/fonts).

# How to use it
Visit [https://generateapassphrase.netlify.app](https://generateapassphrase.netlify.app)
You can click the passphrase to copy it.
